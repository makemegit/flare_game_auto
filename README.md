# flare_game_auto

Simple bash script for INSTALLING, UPDATING and RUNNING the flare-game in a single directory.

How it works?

1. Download and run the script in your desired directory (WARNING! ONLY RUN THIS SCRIPT IN A PREPARED DIRECTORY or EDIT IT).
2. If there is no previous installation in that directory it will install it for you from the original game repo.
3. If it is already installed, it will try to update it and then run it.

Usage:

git clone https://github.com/makemegit/flare_game_auto
cd flare_game_auto
chmod +x flare-game-auto
./flare-game-auto


---todo---

Try to set all the setting and save files in the same directory.
